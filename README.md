This document defines a standard format for notification of meteor events by a meteor network, for the benefit of other networks.  The data consists of:

•	The Event Log, which is a list of detections made by the cameras in the network over the latest 72 hours and is continually updated; and  

•	The Camera Location File, which is a list of data for each camera in the network and is updated when a camera is moved or added.

This notification format is based on a proposal by Mike Hankey that arose during an e-mail discussion following the Europlanet Virtual Fireballs Conference in June 2021.
