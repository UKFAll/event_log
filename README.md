A standard  for notification of fireball events by a meteor network, for the benefit of other meteor networks, is described here. The data which is exchanged consists of:

•	The Event Log, which is a list of detections made by the cameras in the network over the latest 7 days (i.e. 168 hours) and which is continually updated; and  

•	The Camera Location File, which is a list of data for each camera in the network (principally approximate location and the camera’s field of view) and is updated when a camera is moved or added.

•	The Fireball List (optional), a list of times/dates on which the network thinks that a fireball event has happened within the last 168 hours, and which is continually updated.  

This notification format is based on a proposal by Mike Hankey that arose during an e-mail discussion following the Europlanet Virtual Fireballs Conference in June 2021.
